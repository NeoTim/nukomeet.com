Git is an important tool in our toolbox. After few years of using it we realized that there are still things about it we are not yet familiar with. That’s why we decided to organize an internal Git workshop.

![Git Workshop at Nukomeet](/assets/images/blog/git_logo.jpg "Git Workshop at Nukomeet")

The workshop will start with an introduction to internals of Git: its architecture, building blocks and concepts. Then we will talk about our process at Nukomeet. We will finish by discussing simple methods for keeping Git repository clean and healthy.

The workshop will take place at our new space in the city of Poznań on February 11th. Feel free to join us if you’re around
