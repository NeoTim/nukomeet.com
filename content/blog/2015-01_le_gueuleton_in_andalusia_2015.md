January is a cold and gray month in most of Europe. For that reason we decided to organize our next Gueuleton in Andalusia. With a beautiful sun and an average of 14 °C it’s a perfect place to recharge your batteries and start the new year with a boost of energy.

We rented a cosy apartment in central Cadiz for the whole month and focused on two important things: work and surf. Cádiz, situated on a peninsula, is home to some of Spain's most beautiful beaches. It is a cool spot for novice surfers.

We used this time to finish the redesign of our website and to work on some of our internal products with a special focus on our new brainstorming app, called « Voila! ».

We also had some visitors:

* Adrien, product marketer, who writes at [digitalhobo.co][1] and is a recent alumni of [Le Wagon][2] in Paris,
* Augustin, ex CTO of [Copass][3],
* Paul, lead developer at [CapitaineTrain][4], who gave us a master class about [Ember][5]
